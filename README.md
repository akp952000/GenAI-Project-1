# GenAI Project - 1 
# Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Titanic Survival Using Generative AI and Traditional Methods
# Summary 
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using both traditional data analysis techniques and Generative AI models. By leveraging the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, the project follows a comprehensive workflow that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.
# Objective
- Data Analysis: Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and statistically analyze the data to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
- Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features using both traditional methods and Generative AI techniques.
- Model Building: Train and evaluate traditional machine learning models like logistic regression and decision trees.
- Generative AI: Implement Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment the dataset and enhance feature engineering.
- Model Evaluation: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate and compare the performance of the models.
- Insights and Interpretation: Interpret the results, discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach, and provide business insights.
# Expected Outcomes
- A robust predictive model for Titanic survival.
- A comparative analysis showing the effectiveness of traditional methods versus Generative AI techniques.
- Enhanced understanding of how Generative AI can be used to augment datasets and improve model performance.
- Comprehensive documentation and visual presentations summarizing the findings and methodologies.
